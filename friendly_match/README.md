# Overview
During the actual competition in Chinese Taipei, two out of three days will utilize AWS event platforms.
Since Day 1 includes a task that has never been used in WorldSkills before, it will provide an opportunity to experience it in advance through a friendly match.
The friendly match is scheduled for October 25 and will run for four hours, followed by a marking and evaluation session.
The test project covered in this friendly match is not an official competition task, and the marking platform used may differ from the version used in the actual competition, as it will be updated for the main event.

# Requirements
- An empty AWS account
- Laptop
- Internet connection
- Camera (optional but recommended)

# Schedule
